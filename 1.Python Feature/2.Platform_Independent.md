**In IT, we have Two Types of Programming Languages. They are**

1. Platform Dependent Languages
2. Platform Independent Language

---

**1. Platform Dependent Languages**

In Platform Dependent Lang, Data Types differ from One OS to Another OS and These Lang are PLATFORM DEPENDENT.  
Example: C, C++....etc

---

**2. Platform Independent Language**

In Platform Independent Lang, The Memory Space taken by Data Types remains Same on All Types OSes.  
In Effective Platform Independent Lang, all types of Values will store in the form of OBJECTs and they can store Un-Limited amount of data.

Hence Java Object contains Size Restricted and Memory space Restricted where Python Objects contain Un-limited Size and unlimited values can store.

**NOTE**:
IN PYTHON ALL VALUES ARE STORED IN THE FORM OF OBJECTS.  
Examples: Java, PYTHON
