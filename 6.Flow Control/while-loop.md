				Looping OR Iterative OR Repetative Statements
		============================================================
=>The purpose of Looping OR Iterative OR Repetative Statements is that "To perform Certain Operation /Task Repeatedly OR Iteratively for Finite Number of Times until Test Condition becomes False."
=>In Python Programming, we have  TWO Looping OR Iterative OR Repetative Statements. They are

			1. while loop  OR while...else loop
			2. for loop OR for...else loop
=>While we are dealing with Looping OR Iterative OR Repetative Statements, we must ensure THREE important Factors. They are
			1. Initlization Part ( Where to Start )
			2. Conditional Part ( How long to contiue and Where to Stop )
			3. Updation Part ( Incrementation OR Decrementation )



Req  to generate the series of Values

			1					i=1
			2					while(i<=10):
			3						print(i)
			4						i=i+1
			5
			6
			7
			8
			9
			10
