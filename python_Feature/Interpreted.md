When we develop any python program, we must give some file name with an extension .py (File Name.py).

When we execute python program, two process taken place internally
   a) Compilation Process
   b) Execution Process

   **Compilation Process**

In COMPILATION PROCESS, The python Source Code submitted to Python Compiler and It reads the source Code Line by Line, Check for errors by verifying syntaxes and if no errors found then Python Compiler Converts into Intermediate Code called BYTE CODE with an extension .pyc (FileName.pyc).

If errors are found in source code then we get errors displayed on the console.

**Execution Process**

In EXECUTION PROCESS, The PVM reads the Python Intermediate Code(Byte Code) Line by Line and Converted into Machine Understable Code (Executable or binary Code) and It is read by OS and Processor and finally Gives Result.

Hence In Python Program execution, Compilation Process and Execution Process is taking place Line by Line conversion and It is one of the Interpretation Based Programming Language.
