      - All the Modules starts with small letters
            Examples:  math, calendar,random,os,.....etc

- Memory Management
    - Python Provides in-built Garbage Collector Facility. So that Garbage Collector  runs along with a Regular Python Program and whose Role is to Collect OR Remove Unused Memory Space and Improves the Performance of Python Based Applications.
